# Bikeshare Data Analysis Project

## Date Created
February 2026

## Project Overview
This project analyzes US bikeshare data for three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
The script allows users to explore travel patterns by city, month, and day of week.

## Description
The bikeshare analysis program prompts the user for filtering criteria and then calculates
statistics such as:
- Most common travel times
- Popular stations and trips
- Total and average trip duration
- User demographics

The goal of this project is to demonstrate basic data analysis skills using Python and to
practice version control using Git and GitHub.

## Files Used
- bikeshare.py
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

(Note: CSV files are excluded from the GitHub repository using .gitignore.)

## How to Run
Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python bikeshare.py
